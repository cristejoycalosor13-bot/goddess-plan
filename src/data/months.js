// Goddess habit journey — 12 progressive months starting in June.
// Array is in calendar order (index 0 = January) so the calendar maps correctly,
// but the journey builds June → May. Each month layers one habit on top of the last.

  // January — Journey month 8
  {
    name: 'January',
    ch: 'Eat SLOW & 80% Full',
    why: "Eat slowly, chew fully, and stop at 80% — light, never stuffed. This keeps the stomach flatter than rushing to 100% full.",
    tasks: [
      'Week 1 — Put your fork/spoon down between every bite. No screens while eating.',
      'Week 2 — Chew each bite 20–30 times until almost liquid before swallowing.',
      'Week 3 — Stop at 80% full. Pause mid-meal and ask: could I comfortably walk right now?',
      'Week 4 — Eat every meal slow, small, and to 80%. Notice your flatter stomach.',
    ],
  },
  // February — Journey month 9
  {
    name: 'February',
    ch: 'Hydration & Skin',
    why: "Hydrate steadily to support clear skin and reduce puffiness. Add collagen and tea for glow and digestion.",

    ],
  },
  // March — Journey month 10
  {
    name: 'March',
    ch: 'Sleep & Stress',
    why: "Glutes grow during sleep. Deep sleep releases growth hormone and lowers cortisol, the stress hormone linked to belly fat and bloating.",
    tasks: [
      'Week 1 — Set a fixed bedtime for 7.5–9 hrs of sleep. Non-negotiable.',
      'Week 2 — Screens off + dim lights 60 min before bed; gentle stretch instead.',
      'Week 3 — Add a daily 5-min calm practice (breathing, journaling, or a slow walk).',

    ],
  },
  // April — Journey month 11
  {
    name: 'April',
    ch: 'Progressive Overload — Glute Peak',

      'Week 1 — Log your current weights on hip thrust, RDL, and sumo squat.',
      'Week 2 — Add 1–2 kg to each main lift when all sets feel controlled.',

  },
  // June — Journey month 1 (START HERE)
  {
    name: 'June',
    ch: 'Glute Foundation',
    why: "Learn your three glute days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). Build the mind-muscle connection so glutes, not back or quads, do the work.",
    tasks: [

      'Week 2 — Add glute activation (bridges + clamshells) before every glute session.',
      'Week 3 — Nail your form on hip thrust, RDL, and Bulgarian split squat — go lighter if needed.',

  },
  // July — Journey month 2

      'Week 1 — Learn the vacuum: exhale all air, pull navel in and up, hold 15 sec × 3.',
      'Week 2 — Do vacuums every morning before your first drink of water.',
      'Week 3 — Build to 4 × 20-sec holds daily; add them into your core days too.',

    ],
  },
  // August — Journey month 3
  {
    name: 'August',
    ch: 'Two Clocks — Glute Days & Core Days',
    why: "Learn the two eating clocks. On glute days you eat from the moment you wake: banana and coffee, banana and protein after training, protein and carbs at 5 PM. On every other day nothing passes your lips before noon or after five.",
    tasks: [
      'Week 1 — Get the glute-day banana right: one before training, one straight after. Every single session.',
      'Week 2 — Hold the 12–5 window on Tue, Thu, Sat and Sun. Water, tea and psyllium through the morning fast.',

      'Week 4 — Make post-meal walks automatic. Notice digestion and energy.',
    ],
  },
  // October — Journey month 5
  {
    name: 'October',
    ch: 'Shoulder Healing & Posture',
    why: "Shoulder pain comes from weak stabilisers and a tight chest, not weak arms. Light-load, high-rep work on the rotator cuff, lower traps, and serratus makes the joint strong and pain-free — without adding size.",
    tasks: [
      'Week 1 — Both upper-body days, mobility first. Band pull-aparts and wall angels every single session.',
      'Week 2 — Add the doorway chest stretch daily, not just on training days — the tight chest is the root cause.',
      'Week 3 — Keep the load light and add reps instead of weight. Note pain levels before and after each session.',
      'Week 4 — Compare shoulder pain to Week 1. Only add overhead pressing once you have been pain-free 2–3 weeks.',

  // November — Journey month 6
  {
    name: 'November',
    ch: 'Forearm Stand — Weekend Skill',

    ],
  },
  // December — Journey month 7
  {
    name: 'December',
    ch: 'Gut Healing — Meal Rhythm Mastery',
    why: "Tie the rhythm together: glute days eat early and eat three times, core days hold the 12–5 window and eat twice. Fish lands on glute days only.",
    tasks: [
      'Week 1 — Run both clocks without thinking about it. Fish on Mon/Wed/Fri, yogurt bowls and fruit the rest.',
      'Week 2 — Steam or boil all veg — no oils, no dairy, no gluten (GODSSSS out).',
      'Week 3 — Notice your trigger foods; drop anything that bloats you even a little.',
      'Week 4 — Gut calm, stomach flat. Journal bloating, skin, and mood vs. June.',
    ],
  },
